  abstract  = {Data-flow analysis is a versatile technique that can be used to
               address a variety of analysis problems. Typically, data flow analyzers
               are hand-crafted to solve a particular analysis problem.
               The cost of constructing analyzers can be high and is a barrier to
               evaluating alternative analyzer designs. We describe an architecture
               that facilitates the rapid prototyping of data flow analyzers.
               With this architecture, a developer chooses from a collection of
               pre-existing components or, using high-level component generators,
               constructs new components and combines them to produce a data flow analyzer.
               In addition to support for traditional data flow analysis problems,
               this architecture supports the development of analyzers for a class
               of combined data flow problems that offer increased precision.
               This architecture allows developers to investigate quickly and easily
               a wide variety of analyzer design alternatives and to understand the
               practical design tradeoffs better. We describe our experience using
               this architecture to construct a variety of different data flow analyzers.},
