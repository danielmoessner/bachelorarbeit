Feel free to use, correct, and add entries in these files.
But please do not change the format of existing entries.
Before you add, double check if the entry already exists.

Please adhere to the following formatting guideline 
(as used by Tom and Dirk since 2004), as they give 
all necessary information to identify a paper, but not much more.

If you want to use a different format, please start your own file!
