    Software verification received lots of attention in the past two decades.
    Nonetheless, it remains an extremely difficult problem.
    Some verification tasks cannot be solved automatically by any of today’s verifiers.
    To still verify such tasks, one can combine the strengths of different verifiers.
    A promising approach to create combinations is conditional model checking (CMC).
    In CMC, the first verifier outputs a condition that describes
    the parts of the program state space that it successfully verified,
    and the next verifier uses that condition to steer its exploration towards
    the unverified state space.
    Despite the benefits of CMC, only few verifiers can handle conditions.
    To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic plug-and-play extension
    for verifiers. Instead of modifying verifiers, we suggest to add a preprocessor:
    the reducer.
    The reducer takes the condition and the original program and computes
    a residual program that encodes the unverified state space in program code.
    We developed one such reducer and use it to integrate existing verifiers
    and test-case generators into the CMC process.
    Our experiments show that we can solve many additional verification tasks
    with this reducer-based construction.

  abstract  = {
    Continuous testing during development is a well-established technique
    for software-quality assurance.
    Continuous model checking from revision to revision is not yet established
    as a standard practice,
    because the enormous resource consumption makes its application impractical.
    Model checkers compute a large number of verification facts that
    are necessary for verifying if a given specification holds.
    We have identified a category of such intermediate results that are
    easy to store and efficient to reuse: abstraction precisions.
    The precision of an abstract domain specifies the level of abstraction
    that the analysis works on.
    Precisions are thus a precious result of the verification effort and
    it is a waste of resources to throw them away after each verification run.
    In particular, precisions are reasonably small and thus easy to store;
    they are easy to process and have a large impact on resource consumption.
    We experimentally show the impact of precision reuse
    on industrial verification problems created from
    62 Linux kernel device drivers
    with 1119 revisions.

                The context of our work is a project that focuses on
                methods and tools for modeling enterprise
                architectures. An enterprise architecture model
                represents the structure of an enterprise across
                multiple levels, from the markets in which it operates
                down to the implementation of the technical systems
                that support its operation. These models are based on
                an ontology that defines the model elements and their
                relations. In this paper, we describe an efficient
                method to fully automatically verify the design that
                our modeling tool manages. We specify the ontology in
                Alloy, and use the efficient interpreter for
                relational programs CrocoPat to verify that the design
                fulfills all constraints specified in the
                ontology. Technically, we transform all constraints
                from Alloy into a relational program in CrocoPat's
                programming language. Then, we execute the relational
                program and feed it with a relational representation
                of the design as input, in order to check that the
                design element instances fulfill all constraints of
                the Alloy representation of the ontology. We also
                present the current limitations of our approach and
                how -by overcoming these limitations- we can develop
                an Alloy-based parameterized modeling tool.

                Many software model checkers are based on predicate
                abstraction.  If the verification goal depends on
                pointer structures, the approach does not work well,
                because it is difficult to find adequate predicate
                abstractions for the heap.  In contrast, shape
                analysis, which uses graph-based heap abstractions,
                can provide a compact representation of recursive data
                structures.  We integrate shape analysis into the
                software model checker BLAST.  Because shape analysis
                is expensive, we do not apply it globally.  Instead,
                we ensure that, like predicates, shape graphs are
                computed and stored locally, only where necessary for
                proving the verification goal.  To achieve this, we

                been used only for predicate abstractions, to
                three-valued logical structures.  This approach does
                not only increase the precision of model checking, but
                it also increases the efficiency of shape analysis.

                Co-change visualization is a method to recover the
                subsystem structure of a software system from the
                version history, based on common changes and visual
                clustering.  This paper presents the results of
                applying the tool CCVisu, which implements co-change
                visualization, to the two open-source software systems
                PostgreSQL and ArgoUML.  The input of the method is
                the co-change graph, which can be easily extracted by
                CCVisu from a CVS version repository.  The output is a
                graph layout that places software artifacts that were
                often commonly changed at close positions, and
                artifacts that were rarely co-changed at distant
                positions.  This property of the layout is due to the
                clustering property of the underlying energy model,
                which evaluates the quality of a produced layout.  The
                layout can be displayed on the screen, or saved to a
                file in SVG or VRML format.

                Web application development using distributed
                components and web services presents new software
                integration challenges, because solutions often cross
                vendor, administrative, and other boundaries across
                which neither binary nor source code can be shared.
                We present a methodology that addresses this problem
                through a formalism for specifying and manipulating
                behavioral interfaces of multi-threaded open software
                components that communicate with each other through
                method calls.  An interface constrains both the
                implementation and the user of a web service to
                fulfill certain assumptions that are specified by the
                interface.  Our methodology consists of three
                increasingly expressive classes of interfaces.
                Signature interfaces specify the methods that can be
                invoked by the user, together with parameters.
                Consistency interfaces add propositional constraints,
                enhancing signature interfaces with the ability to
                specify choice and causality.  Protocol interfaces
                specify, in addition, temporal ordering constraints on
                method invocations.  We provide approaches to check if
                two or more interfaces are compatible; if a web
                service can be safely substituted for another one; and
                if a web service satisfies a specification that
                represents a desired behavioral property.

                For timed automata, the current version of the tool

                checking is possible.  To find good variable orderings
                it uses the component structure of the model and an
                upper bound for the BDD size.  For hybrid automata,
                reachability analysis based on the double description
                method is implemented.

                This paper investigates the efficient reachability
                analysis of timed automata. It describes a
                discretization of time which preserves the
                reachability properties. The discretization allows to
                represent sets of configurations of timed automata as
                binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Further techniques,
                like computing good variable orderings, are applied to
                use the full potential of BDDs as compact and
                canonical representation of large sets.  We
                implemented these concepts within the tool Rabbit.
                The highly improved performance is shown for some
                example models. For additional speedup we used an
                on-the-fly algorithm and refinement checking for large
                models.

                One problem of modelling hybrid systems with existing
                notations of hybrid automata is that there is no

                extended modelling notation which allows the modelling

                Today, many industrial production cells are controlled
                by software. Many such systems have to deal with
                requirements which the developer has to
                guarantee. Because of the complexity of the
                implementation one of the main problems for developing
                the software for reactive systems is to be sure that
                such properties are fulfilled. One way to handle the
                problems is to use formal methods: This means to
                develop a formal model which is used to prove the
                properties of the specification with tool support.
                <BR>
                There are many different methods to model such
                reactive systems. Some of these abstract from
                real-time aspects of the system. We chose a problem
                area where we have real-time requirements, for example
                the throughput of the modelled production cell. So we
                have to use formal methods which support models of
                real-time systems.

                We build on work in designing modeling languages for
                hybrid systems in the development of CTA, the Cottbus
                Timed Automata. Our design features a facility to
                specify a hybrid system modulary and hierarchically,
                communication through CSP-like synchronizations but
                with special support to specify explicitly different
                roles which the interface signals and variables of a
                module play, and to instantiate recurring elements
                serveral times from a template. Continuous system
                components are modeled with analogue variables having
                piecewise constant derivatives. Discrete system
                aspects like control modes are modeled with the
                discrete variables and the states of a finite
                automaton. Our approach to specifying distributed
                hybrid systems is illustrated with the specification
                of a component of a production cell, a transport belt.
